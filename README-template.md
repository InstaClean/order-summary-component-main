## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am comfortable with HTML, however CSS has always been something that takes a lot of effort for me to wrap my head around. I discovered Sass when I started this project. Preprocessing certainly helped me through this project, and I am very happy I discovered it, as I will certainly use it in bigger future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/) - CSS is not my strongsuit, so w3 helped me with the hard to remember nuances of CSS properties
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This is my first time using a CSS preprocessor in a project, not too much of a learning curve, but this was certainly helpful getting me up to speed on how CSS preprocessing works
